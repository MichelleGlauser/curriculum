### Languages

### Frameworks
- FW1
- FW2

### Primary Goals
1. Include the SWBAT/AWBAT in this section.
Each project's primary learning outcomes should directly reflect the SWBAT for each Topic that is covered with the project. For example - the second project for the apprentices is Front End Fundamentals (FEFs). FEFs should include all the SWABTs for HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery. :

## HTML & CSS 
- Write semantic markup using `<html> <head> <title> <body> <h1-6> <p> <ul>/<ol>/<li> <code>`
- Use `<a>` and `<img>` and explain the difference between a tag, tag name, tag attribute, and the content contained by the tag
- Add structure to a site using `<div> <span> <nav>` and use CSS selectors to style different sections differently
- Write CSS selectors that target a specific tag
- Change the color, background-color, font, font-size, text-align, cursor
- Select HTML elements using the type, .class, and #id CSS selectors
- Explain the difference between classes and ids
- Explain what CSS properties and CSS values are and how they're related
- Describe the 3 ways that CSS code can be incorporated into a project 
- Sketch the basic file tree for web projects 
- Describe several text properties that can be altered using CSS
- Describe how borders can be styled using CSS
- Describe the hierarchy of specificity for CSS selectors
- Describe the different parts of the "Box" model
- Effectively use the display property

## Bootstrap
- Incorporate Bootstrap by linking to it from a CDN
- Incorporate Bootstrap by downloading it to their project directory
- Create a responsive layout that looks appropriate in both desktop and mobile browsers
- Design a website using the 12-column grid system
- Inspect an HTML's box model using Chrome's developer tools

## jQuery
- Select a DOM element (much more easily now!)
- Modify existing elements and insert new ones
- Link to jQuery in their HTML pages in the correct place
- Incorporate jQuery code in the correct place in their HTML files
- Select HTML elements by their element type, class, and ID with jQuery
- Implement the .on("click") and .on("hover") jQuery methods
- Implement the .append() jQuery method
- Implement the .remove() and .empty() jQuery methods


### Overview
In this project, you will (what they will do) and practice (what they will practice) in order to (what they will learn).

### Context
- This is what you already know, and we are building on top of it.
- This is why you are building this app.
- This is the value to your future self if you do this lab exercise.

### Basic Requirements
1. Apprentices will obtain a code review by asking for a code review using the Techtonica #tech-help Slack channel.
2. Apprentices will submit project by Friday of the week that it is assigned.

## Setup Instructions (DO NOT DELETE - GOES IN EVERY PROJECT)
Use the Terminal for navigating around the file system and creating new folders and files. Refer to the lesson on [Shell Commands](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LuOLcpSAtNQlbULx9nWgXJNhgWQlfQ4nzLWQ0DuuPQk/edit?usp=sharing) if you need guidance on using the Terminal.

When you get to the steps below that ask you to initialize a git repo and track files using git, refer to the lesson on [Git and Version Control](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1znMOomkIkAkFKIz2e6t5tLpyzObKqOwfd90fsixSiec/edit?usp=sharing) if you need guidance.

Navigate to the `techtonica-labs` folder located in your Desktop.  
Create a new folder called `getting-started-with-node` within the `techtonica-labs` folder.  
Navigate to `getting-started-with-node`.  
Initialize `getting-started-with-node` as a git repository.  

If you have questions, try not to ask other pairs until you have spent 15-20 minutes troubleshooting within your own pair. Post a message on the #tech-help channel in Slack if you and your pair partner are still stuck after 15-20 minutes. Be sure to format your question using the template we practiced in the [Asking Good Questions](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O45nkq2bZX4ZDenmmA1lJ3iTvI80RXiPuOX2w__6Ykw/edit?usp=sharing) lesson.

### Questions to Consider
- Ask questions here that connect what is being done in the project to what was covered in the given week's Topic Outlines.
- Ask questions that connect this project to prior Topic Outlines or Independent Practice.
- Also ask questions that require the student to put together multiple pieces of knowledge to arrive at an answer or opinion.

### Extensions
- What deliverables can students work on once they have fulfilled the basic requirements for this project? 
- What do these deliverables add to their understanding of the topic?
- Extensions are designed for apprentices who are moving through the material faster than other apprentices. They should reinforce or build on the concepts from this project. Apprentices should not work ahead in the curriculum by starting on the next Topic Outline.
